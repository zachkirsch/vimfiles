How to Succeed in Public Forum Debate,textbooks,<p>Public Forum is the said to be the largest and fastest growing debate event in the National Speech and Debate Association. Yet&#44; there are few good resources that exist to provide coaches and students with a strong introduction to not just the structure and rules of the activity&#44; but also to the strategy of the event. This book is an effort at doing just that. However&#44; while the overall thrust of the text is introductory&#44; many readers will find that the content in the strategy sections of the book contains concepts that are new to them and quite useful. This book contains information that ought to be useful for all members of the Public Forum community&#44; from the brand new coach or competitor to the most seasoned veteran.</p><p>Public Forum is unique in that it is approached in very different ways depending on region&#44; state&#44; league&#44; or even school. Partly due to its youth and partly due to the lack of a strong&#44; developed national community&#44; Public Forum lacks a cohesive sense of self. For the writer&#44; this provides a challenge. Ought a book on the event assume that one approach is superior and instruct from that perspective? Ought it instead offer a survey of the different approaches to each and every question? The former (being elitist and presumptive) and the latter (being hopelessly devoid of direction) are both likely to be unhelpful to the average reader.</p><p>This book instead will approach the event under the guiding principle that &quot;good debate is good debate.&quot; Personal and ideological preferences aside&#44; there is a set of core principles that all can agree constitute good debate technique. In focusing on these principles&#44; this book will cover concepts that will be helpful for all coaches and students&#44; regardless of location or debate philosophy. Certainly&#44; there will be a reflection of this author&#39;s bias in some of the concepts in the book. This is unavoidable. However&#44; a serious effort has been put forth to minimize the influence of those biases and provide as objective an analysis of the activity as possible. There will be some points throughout the book where a focus on widely-accepted principles will not provide a complete picture. In such situations&#44; references will be made to applying one&#39;s local standards and/or a survey of different approaches will be provided.</p><p>Finally&#44; it is worth noting that all things written about debate are an artifact of the time in which they are written. As the activity continues to develop&#44; some of the content in this book may no longer be as accurate as it once was. That being said&#44; avoid the immediate impulse of writing advice off as being outdated or otherwise irrelevant to you. As will be covered in the first chapter of the book&#44; status quo debate practices are not always correct and you ought to always be critical of the way things are currently being done. A tension between what this book says and what you are familiar with does not necessarily mean that this book is wrong; in most if not all cases&#44; the book is going to provide at least some important considerations to keep in mind.</p><p>Public Forum has a lot to offer and this book should provide you with a better understanding of not only the activity&#44; but also the strategies that contribute toward winning rounds.</p>,pf,img/products/how-to-succeed-in-public-forum-debate.png,20,https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/272281/89573BCD/add_to_cart
The Value and Criterion Handbook,textbooks,<p>Two principles have guided the process of bringing you this updated version of the Value and Criterion handbook. First&#44; we place a great deal of emphasis on debate applicability. Our hope is not only that readers will gain a deeper understanding of the philosophical concepts commonly deployed in LD Debate&#44; but also that they will be able to utilize that knowledge in constructing case positions&#44; writing blocks and frontlines&#44; and engaging opposing positions. For that reason you will see debate applicability emphasized throughout the text.</p><p>Second&#44; we hope that this book will be a jumping-off point for further exploration and research of these important and compelling schools of thought. No essay in this handbook is a comprehensive guide to its subject matter. While you will be able to deploy many of the concepts you learn right away&#44; we also hope to give you the resources to dig deeper into topic areas that interest you and to navigate philosophical writing with more confidence and understanding. In other words&#44; this book provides you with the foundation to engage value debate in a way that is not only philosophically competent but also innovative.</p><p>The main author is Eric Beerbohm&#44; who is now Frederick S. Danzinger Associate Professor of Government and the Committee on Social Studies at Harvard University and Director of Graduate Fellowships at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. His philosophical and teaching interests include democratic theory&#44; theories of distributive justice&#44; and the philosophy of social science.He is currently working on an account of democratic lawmaking addressed to legislators who find themselves in conditions that are unjust&#44; corrupt&#44; or collectively irrational. The project is an attempt to identify principles that bear upon political compromise&#44; legislative leadership&#44; and the limits of obstructionism. His book&#44; In Our Name: The Ethics of Democracy (Princeton University Press&#44; 2012)&#44; considers the responsibilities of citizens for the actions of their state. He has also written on the implications of moral uncertainty for political decision-making&#44; the demandingness of deliberative democracy&#44; and the moral risks imposed by anti-egalitarian social policies. A Marshall Scholar and Mellon Fellow in the Humanities and Social Sciences&#44; he received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2008&#44; B.Phil. in Philosophy from Oxford University&#44; and BA in Political Science and the Program in Ethics in Society from Stanford University. He was a Faculty Fellow at the Safra Center for Ethics in 2008-2009. He is a recipient of the 2012 Roslyn Abramson Award&#44; given annually to two Harvard faculty in Arts and Sciences for &quot;excellence and sensitivity in undergraduate teaching.&quot;</p><p>Our contributors also include:<ul><li>Jake Nebel</li><li>Ryan Davis</li><li>Peter van Elswyk</li><li>Eric Pai</li><li>Christian Tarsney</li><li>Marshall Thompson</li><li>Priya Aiyar</li><li>Stephen Babb</li><li>Jeremy Mallory</li><li>Tara Norris</li><li>Fred Carroll</li></ul></p>,ld,img/products/the-value-and-criterion-handbook.png,30,https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/272279/66EB0486/add_to_cart
The Lincoln-Douglas Debate Canon,textbooks,<p>Some works of philosophy and political theory have developed into foundational texts for our modern moral and political sensibilities. In Lincoln-Douglas debate&#44; we have adopted a core argument set that is largely derived from these texts. Thomas Hobbes&#44; John Locke&#44; Immanuel Kant&#44; and John Stuart Mill are giants of Enlightenment Era philosophy. It is not surprising that you see their major arguments applied to just about every LD resolution.</p><p>Our goal with this volume is to guide you through reading and interpreting the works of these thinkers. While secondary sources will be a valuable part of your research&#44; we believe that reading the original texts in this volume is an important part of your LD Debate education. First&#44; reading the original works often helps you to understand the context of different arguments or quotations from the text. For example&#44; sometimes John Locke uses the term &quot;property&quot; to mean things people possess like estates and personal goods. Other times he uses the term more broadly to mean anything to which someone is entitled&#44; including the rights to life and liberty. Reading or hearing quotations out of context can obscure these meanings. Moreover&#44; reading an original work helps you to understand the whole arch of a philosopher&#39;s argument. If you don&#39;t understand that Hobbes is a materialist (as he discusses in the early sections of Leviathan)&#44; it is impossible to understand why he thinks the State of Nature is so dangerous. So&#44; reading the original work will help you to understand these philosophies more fully and clearly.</p><p>Second&#44; debaters often have very inaccurate understandings of these texts. Reading and comprehending the original work will help you correct these misunderstandings and exploit your opponents&#39; failure to prepare. How many times have you heard somebody say something like&#44; &quot;Well&#44; What Kant really said was&hellip;&quot; only to have them describe the argument in a wildly inaccurate way? Don&#39;t rely on hearsay to piece together information about these important arguments &ndash; go right to the source. You will also have a chance to look for caveats or conditions that thinkers often place on their positions&#44; which will help you correct counter-intuitive or potentially radical implications to common positions.</p><p>So&#44; have fun diving into these classic works of enlightenment philosophy. They can often be challenging&#44; but also intellectually stimulating. If you put in some diligent time and effort to understanding these important thinkers&#44; we guarantee you will find your study rewarding.</p><p>Contents:<ul><li>Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes</li><li>Second Treatise of Civil Government by John Locke</li><li>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant</li><li>On Liberty by John Stuart Mill</li><li>Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill</li></ul></p>,ld,img/products/the-lincoln-douglas-debate-canon.png,30,https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/272278/6C67A750/add_to_cart
Advanced Concepts in LD,textbooks,<p>The Victory Briefs Institute is the largest Lincoln-Douglas Debate Camp in the country. For more than a decade we have been helping students reach their full potential at every level of competition&#44; including many winners of the NFL National Championship&#44; the Tournament of Champions&#44; the National Debate Coaches Association Championship&#44; and the CFL National Championship&#44; along with countless invitationals at both a local and national level. We pride ourselves on maintaining an innovative curriculum and seeking out a top-tier instructional staff every summer at UCLA.</p><p>With this volume we are excited to be able to bring you some of our most popular curriculum components in written form. The articles presented are adapted from lectures&#44; seminars&#44; labs&#44; skill workshops&#44; and drill sessions attended by students at VBI Session I&#44; VBI Focus Weeks&#44; and VBI Session II. Each of the authors has been an outstanding camp instructor and has a distinguished debate resume&#44; including high-level success in high school competition&#44; college competition&#44; or as a coach (and in several cases&#44; all of the above).</p><p>The essays that follow cover a range of topics for people on all circuits and at all experience levels. It includes explanations of everything from foundational concepts to advanced strategies. Because there are helpful tips for students of all skill levels&#44; the book will continue to be useful as you develop your debate talents. It is packed with great information from cover to cover&#44; so you&#39;ll be picking up new insights the second and third times you read it.</p><p>In addition to conveying the conceptual basis for different skill and knowledge sets&#44; our goal is to give you practical&#44; implementation-oriented steps to help you improve right away. With that in mind&#44; we encourage you to not only read the book but also take advantage of the drills and other exercises suggested by the authors. It is one thing to know what you&#39;re supposed to do; it&#39;s another to be able to execute it. Getting the most out of this book will require you to put time and effort into practicing these skills and concepts before you use them in competition.</p><p>This book is not meant to provide a comprehensive debate curriculum. Instead&#44; our goal is to give you a sampling of insights on various core topics from some of the top coaches and judges in the activity. There are some suggestions about which some of our authors would undoubtedly disagree. As debaters we know that there is nothing wrong with difference of opinion. If you find our authors recommending a different approach to a given topic&#44; use that as an opportunity to think more about what best fits your style and experience. Like most things&#44; there is more than one way to debate well&#44; and we believe the opportunity to hear different viewpoints will help you to develop the style that is most comfortable for you.</p><p>About our contributors:<ul><li>Jake Nebel is a Marshall Scholar in Philosophy at Oxford. He was Top Speaker at the TOC and ten other major tournaments&#44; and he coached the 2013 TOC champion.</li><li>Marshall Thompson was debate captain at Walt Whitman High School&#44; where he won Greenhill&#44; Bronx&#44; and the MBA Round Robin.</li><li>Christian Tarsney is a PhD candidate in Philosophy at the University of Maryland&#44; College Park.
