## PACMAN


lets do survey at end of 2016s pacman

- hjkl for movements
- Board class
- Discrepancy b/t what gets initialized in constructor vs. set_location() and
  set_random_location()
- Include "constants.h" in every cpp
- shorter instructions (this isn't 40...)
- No makefile?
- Maybe not called BORD_TOP because it's on bottom too. BORD_HORIZ?
- Put rules in manual? (e.g. dots, level?)
- take "ghosts cannot move through walls" out of the ghost.h - in case of above
  and beyond"
- just have them provide *.cpp *.h on every phase, which cpp's they have to
  provide depend on how much they have implemented (e.g. on phase 0, if they've
  started on ghosts, and they don't provide ghost.cpp but there is ghost stuff
  in game.cpp, their could won't compile without ghost.cpp even though no ghosts
  in phase 0)
- they keep passsing around the board in their game functions - teach them to
  not do this
- they implemenet their game like snake (e.g. just continually update the board
  and replace pacman's previous location with a space every time he moves) and
  don't notice any issues because that works for the first few phases. make them
  not do that / change the game so that doesn't work.
  Possibly can solve by adding const to board function:
    bool Pacman::move(const char board[ROWS][COLS], char command)
- clarify in instructions that pacman has to be able to move / turn / move thru
  walls / not move thru boulders.
- instructions are too long that they don't read it / miss important things.
- show level in pacman11 at bottom of game?
- say in spec you can ignore compiler warnings that are for future parts
- clarify that num_moves increments every time move() is called, not just when
  pacman actually changes its row/col (e.g. for trying to go into a boulder or
  when using getacharnow)
- todo: make a version of 'finished' for each phase of the game
- typo in mini-phase 0: wrong font for 'r' in run()
- feedback: phase 1 was v hard, phase 2 was easy
- start at level 0 not level 1 - we are cs students after all
- constant for stopmotion
- change boulder.cpp to break after it reaches border (when printing)...
  otherwise dead squirrels cause very long delays
- cosntants for middle and corners (based on ROWS and COLS)
- for ghosts in corners:
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_GHOSTS/2; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < NUM_GHOST/2; j++)
            ghosts[i + j].set_location( (ROWS - 1) *i, (COLS - 1) * j);
    ^ actually this is worse / less clear / only works for four ghosts anyways
- give them less code. remember how much it sucked to edit ramsey's interpreter

## CLASSES

they're not getting classes in pacman. maybe a project after snake where they
use a snake class where we give them the header file. just so they get the idea
of everything encapsulated within the snake, how the class has functions, and
how they can't access private stuff from outside the snake.

human is good example of class
    attributes - name, age, address, favorite, color
    behavior   - jump, smile,
                 introduce. each person says "Hi I'm [name]", but what they
                 actually say depends on their name attribute

family is good example of classes within classes
    e.g. Family has an array of humans


constructors - put cout statements in the constructor to see when they run

they are having trouble with understanding classes in pacman. we need to
transition better:
    functions in snake struct? (don't like this)
    have a homework / project where they USE a class (just by seeing the header
    file) so they see how it works / how things are encapsulated

teach inheritance - would be good for pacman. class Pacman : Sprite {


## CIPHER

- return *keywithresult so we can result null at the end
- better spec
- plaintext not ciphertext member in kwr - actually maybe just 'result' instead
- make sure cipher constructor arguments in .h match up with .cpp
- maybe for part b have them make their own cipher with the same public interface
  where they are not allowed to change their main(). obviously would be an
  easier cipher - e.g. substitution
- explain next() as giving the item at the top of the pile, or NULL if there is
  nothing left in the pile.
        reset() puts everything back in the pile (in the original order)

## GENERAL

- dpn't teach gdb
- lab quizzes - short / small / on syntax (maybe on prelab too)
- name folders to be what it is in the folder rather than proj2 or lab2
- if we give them less code, there should be some way they see our code to be as
  a model
- more mark stuff
- lower function line limit than 30
- unclear that new is getting from the heap. confusing to say "new is asking the
  computer for memory" because that's what all variables do...
- give them less code. remember how much it sucked to edit ramsey's interpreter
- hescott's no office hours past 5 on project due dates
- they did not do well on recursion on the final.
        in lab: how do you write a recursive function?
                1. make sure it works for the base case e.g. f(0)
                2. assume it works for f(n). i.e. you can call f(n) and it will
                   return the correct result. Now make it work for f(n+1).
                        e.g. assume it works for f(17), you can call f(17) and
                        it works. but it doesn't work for f(18). make it work
                        for f(18) by calling f(17)
